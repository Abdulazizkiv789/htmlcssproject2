Color Scheme:

Primary Color: A strong blue (bg-primary) is used for the header and footer, giving a consistent and professional brand feel.

Contrast: White text on the blue background ensures good readability.

Typography & Hierarchy:

Clear headings (h1, h2, etc.) guide the user through sections.

A balance between bold headers and readable paragraph text (lead, card-text) helps content stand out.

Responsive Layout:

Bootstrap Grid System is used to ensure that product cards display in a single column on small screens, two columns on medium screens, and four on large screens.

Flex utilities (d-flex, mt-auto) help content align properly, especially within product cards.

Hero Section:

Centered and visually inviting with a call-to-action button ("Shop Now") to encourage user engagement right away.

Product Cards:

Consistent layout with an image, title, description, and CTA.

h-100 and shadow-sm classes ensure even height and a slight shadow for visual depth.

Images have alt tags for accessibility and SEO.

Navigation:

Simple, horizontal nav bar aligned to the right for quick access to key pages (Home, Products, About, Contact).

Highlighted using white text to pop against the primary-colored background.

Footer:

Clean and minimal with centered text to round off the page, matching the header styling for brand consistency.
